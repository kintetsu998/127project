HOW TO INSTALL

1. Ensure that you have node.js installed.
3. Ensure that you import the sql file.
4. Install dependencies by `npm install`.
5. Run by `node index.js`.

*note: if there are still more uninstalled dependencies that are not saved in package.json, sorry na. Just inform me if so.

HOW TO MODIFY JSX CODES

1. Ensure that you have browserify and watchify installed.
2. Run by `npm run build`. This will watch for changes in jsx files, and automatically compile them on change. It usually takes a minute to compile in the first time.
